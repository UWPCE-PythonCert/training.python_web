In this tutorial, you'll walk through creating a very simple microblog
application using Django.

Practice Safe Development
=========================

We'll install Django and any other packages we use with it in a virtualenv.

This will ensure that it is isolated from everything else we do in class
(and vice versa)

Remember the basic format for creating a virtualenv::

    $ python -m venv [options] <ENV>
    <or>
    $ pyvenv [options] <ENV>


Set Up a VirtualEnv
-------------------

Start by creating your virtualenv::

    $ python -m venv djangoenv
    <or>
    $ pyvenv djangoenv
    ...

Then, activate it::

    $ source djangoenv/bin/activate
    <or>
    C:\> djangoenv\Scripts\activate.bat


Install Django
--------------

Finally, install Django 1.7.4 using ``pip``::

    (djangoenv)$ pip install Django==1.9
    Collecting Django==1.9
      Downloading Django-1.9-py2.py3-none-any.whl (6.6MB)
        100% |████████████████████████████████| 6.6MB 47kB/s
    Installing collected packages: Django
    Successfully installed Django-1.9
    (djangoenv)$


Our Project
===========

Everything in Django stems from the *project*. To get started learning, we'll
create one. We'll use a script installed by Django, ``django-admin.py``:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ django-admin startproject mysite

If you're on windows, that command is slightly different:

.. code-block:: bash

    django-admin.exe startproject mysite

.. note:: If you run into trouble at this stage, please consult the
          `installation documentation`_. For windows users, see also
          `this guide to installation on Windows`_

.. _installation documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/install/
.. _this guide to installation on Windows: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/windows/


This will create a folder called 'mysite'. The folder contains the following
structure::

    mysite
    ├── manage.py
    └── mysite
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py

If what you see doesn't match that, you're using an older version of Django.
Make sure you've installed 1.7.4


What Got Created
----------------

* **outer *mysite* folder**: this is just a container and can be renamed or
  moved at will
* **inner *mysite* folder**: this is your project directory. It should not be
  renamed.
* **__init__.py**: magic file that makes *mysite* a python package.
* **settings.py**: file which holds configuration for your project, more soon.
* **urls.py**: file which holds top-level URL configuration for your project,
  more soon.
* **wsgi.py**: binds a wsgi application created from your project to the
  symbol ``application``
* **manage.py**: a management control script.

*django-admin* provides a hook for administrative tasks and abilities:

* creating a new project or app
* running the development server
* executing tests
* entering a python interpreter
* entering a database shell session with your database
* much much more (run ``django-admin`` without an argument)

*manage.py* wraps this functionality, adding the full environment of your
project.


How *manage.py* Works
---------------------

Look in the ``manage.py`` script Django created for you. You'll see this:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import os
    import sys

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "mysite.settings")

        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

        execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)

The environmental var ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` is how the ``manage.py``
script is made aware of your project's environment. This is why you shouldn't
rename the project package.


Development Server
------------------

At this point, you should be ready to use the development server::

    (djangoenv)$ cd mysite
    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py runserver
    ...

You'll see a scary warning about unapplied migrations.  Ignore it for a moment.
Instead, load ``http://localhost:8000`` in your browser. You should see this:

.. figure:: /_static/django-start.png
    :align: center
    :width: 98%

.. rst-class:: build center

**Do you?**


Connecting A Database
---------------------

Django supplies its own ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). This ORM sits on top of
the DB-API implementation you choose. You must provide connection information
through Django configuration.

All Django configuration takes place in ``settings.py`` in your project
folder.

Edit your ``settings.py`` to match:

.. code-block:: python


    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mysite.db',
        }
    }

There are other database settings, but they are not used with sqlite3, we'll
ignore them for now.

Django's ORM provides a layer of *abstraction* between you and SQL. You write
Python classes called *models* describing the objects that make up your system.
The ORM handles converting data from these objects into SQL statements (and
back). We'll learn much more about this in a bit.

The final step in preparing to work is to set up the database. You do this by
running *migrations*.  These migrations create the tables needed to support the
models that are required by Django out of the box.

Run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py migrate
    Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: admin, contenttypes, auth, sessions
    Running migrations:
      Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
      Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
      Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
      Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK

Great!  Now we can set up an initial user who'll be able to do anything, a
*superuser*.  Again, we'll use ``manage.py``:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py createsuperuser
    Username (leave blank to use 'cewing'):
    Email address: cris@crisewing.com
    Password:
    Password (again):
    Superuser created successfully.

Notice that as you type your password, it will not appear on the screen.  Don't
worry, it's actually being recorded.  You just can't see it (and neither can
that snoopy git looking over your shoulder).

Projects and Apps
=================

We've created a Django *project*. In Django a project represents a whole
website:

* global configuration settings
* inclusion points for additional functionality
* master list of URL endpoints

A Django *app* encapsulates a unit of functionality:

* A blog section
* A discussion forum
* A content tagging system

.. important:: One *project* can (and likely will) consist of many *apps*

Django already includes some *apps* for you.

.. container:: incremental

    They're in ``settings.py`` in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:

    .. code-block:: python


        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            'django.contrib.admin',
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            'django.contrib.messages',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        )


Our Class App
-------------

We are going to build an *app* to add to our *project*. To start with our app
will be a simple blog. As stated above, an *app* represents a unit within a
system, the *project*. We have a project, we need to create an *app*

This is accomplished using ``manage.py``. In your terminal, make sure you are
in the *outer* mysite directory, where the file ``manage.py`` is located.
Then:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py startapp myblog

This should leave you with the following structure:

.. class:: small

::

    mysite
    ├── db.sqlite3
    ├── manage.py
    ├── myblog
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── admin.py
    │   ├── migrations
    │   │   └── __init__.py
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── tests.py
    │   └── views.py
    └── mysite
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py

Like our Pyramid site, Django divides up functionality by module. You'll create
ORM model classes in the ``models.py`` file, view code in the ``views.py``
file, and so on.

We'll start by defining the main Python class for our blog system, a ``Post``.


Django Models
-------------

Any Python class in Django that is meant to be persisted *must* inherit from
the Django ``Model`` class. This base class hooks in to the ORM functionality
converting Python code to SQL. You can override methods from the base ``Model``
class to alter how this works or write new methods to add functionality.

Learn more about `models <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/db/models/>`_


Our Post Model
--------------

Open the ``models.py`` file created in our ``myblog`` package. Add the
following:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models #<-- This is already in the file
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    class Post(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
        text = models.TextField(blank=True)
        author = models.ForeignKey(User)
        created_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
        modified_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
        published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)

This code defines a subclass of the Django ``Model`` class and added a bunch of
attributes.

* These attributes are all instances of ``Field`` classes defined in Django
* Field attributes on a model map to columns in a database table
* The arguments you provide to each Field customize how it works

  * This means *both* how it operates in Django *and* how it is defined in SQL

* There are arguments shared by all Field types
* There are also arguments specific to individual types

You can read much more about
`Model Fields and options <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/fields/>`_

There are some features of our fields worth mentioning in specific. Notice we
have no field that is designated as the *primary key*

* You *can* make a field the primary key by adding ``primary_key=True`` in the
  arguments
* If you do not, Django will **automatically** create one. This field is always
  called ``id``
* No matter what the primary key field is called, its *value* is always
  available on a model instance as the ``pk`` attribute: ``instance.pk``


Field Details
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    title = models.CharField(max_length=128)

* The required ``max_length`` argument is specific to ``CharField`` fields.
* It affects *both* the Python and SQL behavior of a field.
* In python, it is used to *validate* supplied values during *model validation*
* In SQL it is used in the column definition: ``VARCHAR(128)``

.. code-block:: python

    author = models.ForeignKey(User)

* Django also models SQL *relationships* as specific field types.
* The required positional argument is the class of the related Model.
* By default, the reverse relation is implemented as the attribute
  ``<fieldname>_set``.
* You can override this by providing the ``related_name`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    created_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    modified_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

* ``auto_now_add`` is available on all date and time fields. It sets the value
  of the field to *now* when an instance is first saved.
* ``auto_now`` is similar, but sets the value anew each time an instance is
  saved.
* Setting either of these will cause the ``editable`` attribute of a field to
  be set to ``False``.
* This does not mean you can't update these values, only that they will not
  show in forms by default.

.. code-block:: python

    text = models.TextField(blank=True)
    # ...
    published_date = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)

* The argument ``blank`` is shared across all field types. The default is
  ``False``
* This argument affects only the Python behavior of a field, determining if the
  field is *required*
* The related ``null`` argument affects the SQL definition of a field: is the
  column NULL or NOT NULL
* Django recommends that you **not** use the ``null`` option for text fields.
  It will automatically insert an empty string into the database if the field
  is left blank.


Installing Apps
---------------

In order to use our new model, we need Django to know about our *app*. This is
accomplished by configuration in the ``settings.py`` file. Open that file now,
in your editor, and find the INSTALLED_APPS setting.

You extend Django functionality by *installing apps*. This is pretty simple:

.. code-block:: python


    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'myblog', # <- YOU ADD THIS PART
    )

Once Django is made aware of the existence of this new app, it can  make a new
*migration* that will set up the tables for this new class automatically.

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py makemigrations myblog
    Migrations for 'myblog':
      0001_initial.py:
        - Create model Post

And now you can run that migration to make the changes to your database:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py migrate
    Operations to perform:
      Apply all migrations: sessions, myblog, contenttypes, auth, admin
    Running migrations:
      Rendering model states... DONE
      Applying myblog.0001_initial... OK


The Django Shell
================

Django provides a management command ``shell``:

* Shares the same ``sys.path`` as your project, so all installed python
  packages are present.
* Imports the ``settings.py`` file from your project, and so shares all
  installed apps and other settings.
* Handles connections to your database, so you can interact with live data
  directly.

The Django ``shell`` will use more advanced Python interpreters such as
``iPython`` if they are available. Let's go ahead and install iPython in our
``djangoenv`` to get this advantage:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ pip install ipython
    ...

Let's explore the Model Instance API directly using this shell:

::

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py shell

Instances of our model can be created by simple instantiation:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: from myblog.models import Post
    In [2]: p1 = Post(title='My First Post',
       ...:           text='This is the first post I\'ve written')
    In [3]: p1
    Out[3]: <Post: Post object>

We can also validate that our new object is okay before we try to save it:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [4]: p1.full_clean()
    ...

    ValidationError: {'author': ['This field cannot be null.']}


Django Model Managers
---------------------

We have to hook our ``Post`` to an author, which must be a ``User``. To do
this, we need to have an instance of the ``User`` class. We can use the
``User`` *model manager* to run table-level operations like ``SELECT``.


All Django models have a *manager*. By default it is accessed through the
``objects`` class attribute.

Let's use the *manager* to get an instance of the ``User`` class:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [5]: from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    In [6]: all_users = User.objects.all()
    In [7]: all_users
    Out[7]: [<User: cewing>]
    In [8]: p1.author = all_users[0]

And now our instance should validate properly:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [9]: p1.full_clean()
    In [10]:


Saving New Objects
------------------

Our model has three date fields, two of which are supposed to be
auto-populated:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [11]: print(p1.created_date)
    None
    In [12]: print(p1.modified_date)
    None

Although we've instantiated a Post object, it doesn't have these values yet.
That's because a model is not *created* until it's saved into the database.
When we save our post, these fields will get values assigned:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [13]: p1.save()
    In [14]: print(p1.created_date)
    2015-12-31 19:24:29.019293+00:00
    In [15]: print(p1.modified_date)
    2015-12-31 19:24:29.019532+00:00


Updating An Instance
--------------------

Models operate much like 'normal' python objects. To change the value of a
field, simply set the instance attribute to a new value. Call ``save()`` to
persist the change:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [16]: p1.title = p1.title + " (updated)"
    In [17]: p1.save()
    In [18]: p1.title
    Out[18]: 'My First Post (updated)'


Create a Few Posts
------------------

Let's create a few more posts so we can explore the Django model manager query
API:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [20]: p2 = Post(title="Another post",
       ....:           text="The second one created",
       ....:           author=all_users[0]).save()
    In [21]: p3 = Post(title="The third one",
       ....:           text="With the word 'heffalump'",
       ....:           author=all_users[0]).save()
    In [22]: p4 = Post(title="Posters are a great decoration",
       ....:           text="When you are a poor college student",
       ....:           author=all_users[0]).save()
       ....: Post.objects.count()
    Out[22]: 4


The Django Query API
--------------------

The *manager* on each model class supports a full-featured query API. API
methods take keyword arguments, where the keywords are special constructions
combining field names with field *lookups*.  The double-underscore character
separates the name of a field from the *lookup* value.

.. rst-class:: build small

* title__exact="The exact title"
* text__contains="decoration"
* id__in=range(1,4)
* published_date__lte=datetime.datetime.now()

Each keyword argument adds to the query that will be used to find matching
objects.


QuerySets
---------

A ``QuerySet`` is a special type of object that maintains a relationship to the
database. Query API methods can be divided into two basic groups: methods that
return ``QuerySets`` and those that do not.

The former may be chained without hitting the database:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: a = Post.objects.all()  #<-- no query yet
    In [25]: b = a.filter(title__icontains="post")  #<- not yet
    In [26]: c = b.exclude(text__contains="created")  #<-- nope
    In [27]: [(p.title, p.text) for p in c]  #<-- This will issue the query
    Out[27]:
    [('My First Post (updated)', "This is the first post I've written"),
     ('Posters are a great decoration', 'When you are a poor college student')]

Conversely, the latter will issue an SQL query when executed.

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [28]: a.count()  #<-- immediately executes an SQL query
    Out[28]: 4 


QuerySets and SQL
-----------------

If you are curious, you can see the SQL that a given QuerySet will use:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [29]: print(c.query)
    SELECT "myblog_post"."id", "myblog_post"."title", "myblog_post"."text",
           "myblog_post"."author_id", "myblog_post"."created_date",
           "myblog_post"."modified_date", "myblog_post"."published_date" 
    FROM "myblog_post" 
    WHERE (
        "myblog_post"."title" LIKE %post% ESCAPE '\' 
        AND NOT ("myblog_post"."text" LIKE %created% ESCAPE '\')
    )

The SQL will vary depending on which DBAPI backend you use (yay ORM!!!)

.. note:: Incidentally, using this as a way to learn SQL is not a bad idea.


Exploring the QuerySet API
--------------------------

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/querysets


.. code-block:: ipython

    In [3]: [p.pk for p in Post.objects.all().order_by('created_date')]
    Out[3]: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    In [4]: [p.pk for p in Post.objects.all().order_by('-created_date')]
    Out[4]: [4, 3, 2, 1]
    In [5]: [p.pk for p in Post.objects.filter(title__contains='post')]
    Out[5]: [1, 2, 4]
    In [6]: [p.pk for p in Post.objects.exclude(title__contains='post')]
    Out[6]: [3]
    In [7]: qs = Post.objects.exclude(title__contains='post')
    In [8]: qs = qs.exclude(id__exact=3)
    In [9]: [p.pk for p in qs]
    Out[9]: []
    In [10]: qs = Post.objects.exclude(title__contains='post', id__exact=3)
    In [11]: [p.pk for p in qs]
    Out[11]: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Do all of those make sense to you?  Especially consider the difference between
those last two results? Can you explain that?


Updating via QuerySets
----------------------

You can update all the objects in a QuerySet at the same time. Changes are persisted
without calling the ``save`` instance method:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [12]: qs = Post.objects.all()
    In [13]: [p.published_date for p in qs]
    Out[13]: [None, None, None, None]
    In [14]: from datetime import datetime
    In [15]: from django.utils.timezone import UTC
    In [16]: utc = UTC()
    In [17]: now = datetime.now(utc)
    In [18]: qs.update(published_date=now)
    Out[18]: 4
    In [19]: [p.published_date for p in qs]
    Out[19]:
    [datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 31, 19, 50, 4, 99980, tzinfo=<UTC>),
     datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 31, 19, 50, 4, 99980, tzinfo=<UTC>),
     datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 31, 19, 50, 4, 99980, tzinfo=<UTC>),
     datetime.datetime(2015, 12, 31, 19, 50, 4, 99980, tzinfo=<UTC>)]


Testing Our Model
=================

As with any project, we want to test our work. Django provides a testing
framework to allow this. Django supports both *unit tests* and *doctests*. I
strongly suggest using *unit tests*. You add tests for your *app* to the file
``tests.py``, which should be at the same package level as ``models.py``.

Locate and open this file in your editor.


Django TestCase Classes
-----------------------

**SimpleTestCase** is for basic unit testing with no ORM requirements

**TransactionTestCase** is useful if you need to test transactional
actions (commit and rollback) in the ORM

**TestCase** is used when you require ORM access and a test client

**LiveServerTestCase** launches the django server during test runs for
front-end acceptance tests.

Sometimes testing requires base data to be present. We need a User for ours.
Django provides *fixtures* to handle this need. Create a directory called
``fixtures`` inside your ``myblog`` app directory. This new folder should be
adjacent to the ``tests.py`` file.

.. rst-class:: build

Copy the file ``myblog_test_fixture.json`` from the ``resources/session08``
into this directory, it contains users for our tests.

Now that we have a fixture, we need to instruct our tests to use it.

Edit ``tests.py`` to look like this:

.. code-block:: python


    from django.test import TestCase
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    class PostTestCase(TestCase):
        fixtures = ['myblog_test_fixture.json', ]

        def setUp(self):
            self.user = User.objects.get(pk=1)


Our First Enhancement
---------------------

Look at the way our Post represents itself in the Django shell:

.. code-block:: python

    In [2]: [p for p in Post.objects.all()]
    Out[2]:
    [<Post: Post object>,
     <Post: Post object>,
     <Post: Post object>,
     <Post: Post object>]

Wouldn't it be nice if the posts showed their titles instead? In Django, the
``__str__`` method is used to determine how a Model instance represents
itself. Then, calling ``str(instance)`` gives the desired result.

Let's write a test that demonstrates our desired outcome:

.. code-block:: python

    # add this import at the top
    from myblog.models import Post

    # and this test method to the PostTestCase
    def test_string_representation(self):
        expected = "This is a title"
        p1 = Post(title=expected)
        actual = str(p1)
        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)


To run tests, use the ``test`` management command. Without arguments, it will
run all TestCases it finds in all installed *apps*. You can pass the name of a
single app to focus on those tests.

Quit your Django shell and in your terminal run the test we wrote:

.. code-block:: bash

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py test myblog

We have yet to implement this enhancement, so our test should fail:

::

    Creating test database for alias 'default'...

Let's add an appropriate ``__str__`` method to our Post class.

* It will take ``self`` as its only argument
* And it should return its own title as the result
* Go ahead and take a stab at this in ``models.py``

.. code-block:: python

    class Post(models.Model):
        #...

        def __str__(self):
            return self.title

Re-run the tests to see if that worked::

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py test myblog
    Creating test database for alias 'default'...
    .

What to Test
------------

In any framework, the question arises of what to test. Much of your app's
functionality is provided by framework tools. Does that need testing? I
*usually* don't write tests covering features provided directly by the
framework. I *do* write tests for functionality I add, and for places where I
make changes to how the default functionality works. This is largely a matter
of style and taste (and of budget).

We've only begun to test our blog app. We'll be adding many more tests later.
In between, you might want to take a look at the `Django testing documentation`_:

.. _Django testing documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/


The Django Admin
================

There are some who believe that Django has been Python's *killer app*. And
without doubt the Django Admin is a *killer feature* for Django. To demonstrate
this, we are going to set up the admin for our blog

The Django Admin is, itself, an *app*, installed by default (as of 1.6). Open
the ``settings.py`` file from our ``mysite`` project package and verify that
you see it in the list:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.admin', # <- already present
        # ...
    )

What we need now is to allow the admin to be seen through a web browser. To do
that, we'll have to add some URLs to our project.


Django URL Resolution
---------------------

Like Pyramid, Django has a system for dispatching requests to code: the *urlconf*.

* A urlconf is an iterable of calls to the ``django.conf.urls.url`` function
* This function takes:

  * a regexp *rule*, representing the URL
  * a ``callable`` to be invoked (or a name identifying one)
  * an optional *name* kwarg, used to *reverse* the URL
  * other optional arguments we will skip for now

* The function returns a *resolver* that matches the request path to the
  callable

I said above that a urlconf is an iterable. That iterable is generally built by
calling the ``django.conf.urls.patterns`` function. It's best to build it that
way, but in reality, any iterable will do.

However, the name you give this iterable is **not flexible**. Django will load
the urlconf named ``urlpatterns`` that it finds in the file named in
``settings.ROOT_URLCONF``.

Many Django add-on *apps*, like the Django Admin, come with their own urlconf.
It is standard to include these urlconfs by rooting them at some path in your
site.

You can do this by using the ``django.conf.urls.include`` function as the
callable in a ``url`` call:

.. code-block:: python

    url(r'^forum/', include('random.forum.app.urls'))


Including the Admin
-------------------

We can use this to add *all* the URLs provided by the Django admin in one
stroke.

    verify the following lines in ``urls.py``:

    .. code-block:: python


        from django.contrib import admin # <- should be present already

        urlpatterns = [
            ...
            url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)), #<- this should be too
        ]

We can now view the admin.  We'll use the Django development server.

.. rst-class:: build

In your terminal, use the ``runserver`` management command to start the
development server:

.. rst-class:: build

::

    (djangoenv)$ ./manage.py runserver
    Validating models...

    0 errors found
    Django version 1.4.3, using settings 'mysite.settings'
    Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.


Viewing the Admin
-----------------

Load ``http://localhost:8000/admin/``.  You should see this:

.. figure:: /_static/django-admin-login.png
    :align: center
    :width: 50%

.. rst-class:: build

Login with the name and password you created before.


The Admin Index
---------------

The index will provide a list of all the installed *apps* and each model
registered.  You should see this:

.. image:: /_static/admin_index.png
    :align: center
    :width: 90%

.. rst-class:: build

Click on ``Users``. Find yourself? Edit yourself, but **don't** uncheck
``superuser``.


Add Posts to the Admin
----------------------

Okay, let's add our app model to the admin. Find the ``admin.py`` file in the
``myblog`` package. Open it, add the following and save the file:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.contrib import admin # <- this is already there.
    from myblog.models import Post

    admin.site.register(Post)

Reload the admin index page in your browser. You should now see a listing for
the Myblog app, and an entry for Posts.

Visit the admin page for Posts. You should see the posts we created earlier in
the Django shell. Look at the listing of Posts. Because of our ``__str__``
method we see a nice title.

Are there other fields you'd like to see listed? Click on a Post, note what is
and is not shown.


Next Steps
----------

We've learned a great deal about Django's ORM and Models. We've also spent some
time getting to know the Query API provided by model managers and QuerySets.

We've also hooked up the Django Admin and noted some shortcomings.

In class we'll learn how to put a front end on this, add new models, and
customize the admin experience.
